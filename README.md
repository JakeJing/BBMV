# BBMV
This repository provides a set of R functions to fit general macroevolutionary models for continuous traits evolving in adaptive landscapes of any shape.
This new model is based on [bounded Brownian motion](https://github.com/fcboucher/BBM) (BBM), in which a continuous trait undergoes constant-rate diffusion between two reflective bounds. In addition to this random component, the trait evolves in a potential and is thus subject to a force that pulls it towards specific values - this force can be of any shape. You can see an example of the behaviour of the model in the figure 'BBM+V basics Figure.png', which is in the main directory of this Github page. We label this model BBM+V, for BBM + potential.

Functions of the BBMV package only depend on the {ape} package in R and likelihoods are compatible with those of other models fitted by the 'fitContinuous' function in package {geiger}. The package implements both maximum likelihood and MCMC estimation of model parameters.

Functions were written by [Florian Boucher](https://sites.google.com/site/floriaboucher/) based on equations from [Vincent DÃ©mery](https://www.pct.espci.fr/~vdemery/).

The 'R' folder contains functions to simulate traits evolving under BBM+V, plot adaptive landscapes, and fit the model to empirical data using either maximum-likelihood or MCMC estimation. 
The script 'Example_ML_MCMC.R' shows basic examples of use of the functions to simulate and infer under BBM+V. 

There are currently no help pages for these functions but function names should be rather self-explanatory and R scripts are heavily commented: they should give you all the information needed on parameters, outputs, etc.

The paper describing the model is still work in progress...
